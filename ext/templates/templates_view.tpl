        <p>
            In my second assignment, Introduction to Smarty Templates, I chose to begin developing an idea that was important to me.
            I'm including a screenshot of the site below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now with my course project, I've found that it's quite difficult to simply include the original site without introducing
            a lot of duplication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since this entire course project in fact uses Smarty templates, I've decided to include this mention rather than waste precious time reproducing the original site, which I intend to develop on my personal web host.
